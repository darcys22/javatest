java -cp mylib.jar:. EchoServer 8000  


To build the Jar file that will be the library make a heap of files in a directory that is all under same package namespace

1) Make a Build Directory

2) 
javac -d ./build *.java

if there are no errors in the build directory there should be a class tree.Move int the build directory and

3)
jar cvf YourJar.jar *

Which gives you the Jar of the library

Then to run the library you have to import it in the Java file ie 
import mylib.*;

Then it needs to be on the classpath which is done via
java -cp mylib.jar:. EchoServer 8000
